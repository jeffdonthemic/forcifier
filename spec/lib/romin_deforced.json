The Images service can resize, rotate, flip, and crop images; it can composite multiple images into a single image; and it can convert image data between several formats. It can also enhance photographs using a predefined algorithm. The API can also provide information about an image, such as its format, width, height, and a histogram of color values. The Images service can use a Blobstore value as the source of a transformation.</p>\n\n<p>First Place: $1000<br>Second Place: $500</p>","status":"Winner Selected","challenge_participants__r":{"totalsize":1,"done":true,"records":[{"attributes":{"type":"Challenge_Participant__c","url":"/services/data/v22.0/sobjects/Challenge_Participant__c/a0AU00000009INFMA2"},"has_submission":true,"money_awarded":500.0,"score":94,"place":"2","member":"a0IU0000000CjRcMAK","id":"a0AU00000009INFMA2","status":"Lost","challenge":"a0GU00000000IClMAM"}]}},{"attributes":{"type":"Challenge__c","url":"/services/data/v22.0/sobjects/Challenge__c/a0GU00000000IChMAM"},"prize_type":"Currency","total_prize_money":1500,"end_date":"2011-05-17T04:00:00.000+0000","challenge_categories__r":{"totalsize":3,"done":true,"records":[{"attributes":{"type":"Challenge_Category__c","url":"/services/data/v22.0/sobjects/Challenge_Category__c/a08U0000001riXxIAI"},"category__r":{"attributes":{"type":"Category__c","url":"/services/data/v22.0/sobjects/Category__c/a07U0000000bGhyIAE"},"name":"Google","color":"blue","id":"a07U0000000bGhyIAE"},"category":"a07U0000000bGhyIAE","id":"a08U0000001riXxIAI","challenge":"a0GU00000000IChMAM"},{"attributes":{"type":"Challenge_Category__c","url":"/services/data/v22.0/sobjects/Challenge_Category__c/a08U0000001riXzIAI"},"category__r":{"attributes":{"type":"Category__c","url":"/services/data/v22.0/sobjects/Category__c/a07U0000000bGlWIAU"},"name":"Java","color":"brown","id":"a07U0000000bGlWIAU"},"category":"a07U0000000bGlWIAU","id":"a08U0000001riXzIAI","challenge":"a0GU00000000IChMAM"},{"attributes":{"type":"Challenge_Category__c","url":"/services/data/v22.0/sobjects/Challenge_Category__c/a08U0000001riXyIAI"},"category__r":{"attributes":{"type":"Category__c","url":"/services/data/v22.0/sobjects/Category__c/a07U0000000bGlUIAU"},"name":"Other","color":"purple","id":"a07U0000000bGlUIAU"},"category":"a07U0000000bGlUIAU","id":"a08U0000001riXyIAI","challenge":"a0GU00000000IChMAM"}]},"name":"Google Support Bot","top_prize":"1500","challenge_id":"1109","challenge_type":"Code","id":"a0GU00000000IChMAM","start_date":"2011-05-09T16:00:00.000+0000","description":"With the introduction of the XMPP service to App Engine, it&#39;s now possible to write an App Engine app that communicates with users - or even other applications - over XMPP, otherwise known as Jabber or Google Talk.
